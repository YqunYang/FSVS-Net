## Introduction

FSVS-Net is a few-shot semi-supervised vessel segmentation network with feature distillation and bidirectional weighted fusion. Key innovations include: 

- A feature distillation module to improve the accuracy of vessel representation,.
- Bidirectional weighted fusion strategy for leveraging the relationships between adjacent slices.
- Evaluation on three datasets for hepatic vessels, pulmonary vessels, and renal arteries segmentation.


This repository provides:
- The source code for training and evaluation.
- The labeled datasets.

## Datasets

Related datasets are being orgnized, and are expected to be available in June.
